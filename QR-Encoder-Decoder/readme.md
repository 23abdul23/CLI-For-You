# QR-Encoder-Decoder
A simple tool to encode data in the form of QR Codes, and decrypt data from QRs as well, all through the command- line!

# How-It-Works
- Encoding: The input will be a file(of any format), which will be encoded by this tool in the form of a QR Code, which will be returned in the form of an 
image(.jpg or .png) file. The name of the image file that will store the generated qr must be taken as input from the user.
- Decoding: The input image file with the QR will be the input, and the name of the output file must be taken from the user, with the correct extension(.jpg,.txt etc),
   from which it was encoded.
# ‚ö° Tech-Stack
Any scripting language is allowed- for example python, nodejs, bash etc. So no worries!
