#How_it_works
There are separate folders for each tool, which solve various purposes, like:
- QR Encoder and Decoder: This is a CLI tool that encodes data in the form of a QR code, and can decode QRs as well. 
- TexToImage: This is a Latex style converter, which will take input in a specific text format and convert it to an image file.
- RPG Game: This is a completely "on the command line" game, to satisfy the geeky-gamer within you! There will initially be a basic storyline, which you will have to continue to weave into a complete game- in the form of code! Step by step!
- Code Buddy: This is a helper in your development process. Ever wanted to get rid of the tedious manual strain of writing code that literally anyone could write. before starting with the actual code? Well, this is your chance to build that 'anyone' for you- to write the tedious boiler plate code for you- so that you could come straight to the business logic!

However, this is not all, as the tools go on getting completed, we'll be adding new ones as well- so that the geek in you is never bored!
