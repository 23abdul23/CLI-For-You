The hero wakes up in a strange land, lying on soft, glowing grass. The sky above is unlike anything they’ve ever seen—two suns, one golden and one silver, hang in the sky. 
The hero feels lost and confused. He doesn't remember who he is or how he got here. There is a good scent and strange feeling all around the place and whole area is covered in thick white smoke.

As he struggle to stand, they hear a faint, echoing whisper:
“The fate of this realm lies in your hands, traveler.”
The voice fades, leaving only silence.

Before the hero can make sense of it, a loud explosion shakes the ground. He turn's quickly and as he moves through the thich fog it gets clearer and they start seeing a thick black smoke rising in the distance. 
A village is on fire, and shadowy figures are attacking. The screams of terrified people reach his ears.

Something inside the hero stirs a sense of urgency and purpose. Without knowing why, he feels he must help. With shaky steps, he head's toward the burning village, ready to face whatever lies ahead.
