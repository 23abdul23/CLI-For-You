You wake up to the rhythmic crash of waves and the distant cry of a seabird. Your eyes flutter open to reveal a serene, otherworldly beach bathed in the soft hues of a golden sunrise. The air carries the salty tang of the ocean. The sand beneath you shimmers faintly, as if it holds traces of starlight.
You try to remember who you are, where you came from, and how you got here—but your mind is a blank slate.
As you sit up, you notice a small, ornate locket clutched in your hand. The locket bears an intricate symbol—a phoenix encircled by runes you do not recognize. Inside the locket is a faded parchment with three words scrawled in ink: "Eryndor needs you."
Suddenly, you spot movement near a cluster of jagged rocks further along the shore. A small creature—half crab, half bird—scuttles out. It clicks and chirps nervously, then gestures toward a glowing trail of footprints leading away along the beach. Its movements seem urgent, as if urging you to follow.
You feel an inexplicable pull, as though this trail holds answers to the questions swirling in your mind. With nothing but the locket and the clothes on your back, you rise to your feet. The journey begins—will you uncover the truth about Eryndor, your past, and your role in this enchanted yet perilous land?
The choice is yours: Follow the glowing trail, or accept your doom.
