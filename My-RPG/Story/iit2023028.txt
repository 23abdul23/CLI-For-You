Echoes of the Forgotten

Viraj wakes up with a sharp pain in his head. The world around him is hazy, and the only thing he can clearly hear is the distant sound of rustling leaves. As his vision clears, he realizes he’s lying in the middle of a dense, misty forest, surrounded by strange, glowing plants. The air feels thick with an unfamiliar energy, and the ground beneath him is soft, like the earth is breathing with him.

A cold wind stirs the trees, carrying with it a whisper he can barely make out: “The journey begins now... but not everyone is meant to remember.”

Viraj sits up, heart racing, but his mind is blank. He has no memories—no name, no face, no past. It's as if his life has been erased. The only thing he knows is the overwhelming urge to move forward, to uncover the secrets of this place. Why is he here? Who brought him to this strange land?

He stands, trying to shake off the dizziness, and takes his first steps into the unknown. The forest seems to shift around him as if alive, its shadows watching his every move. The further he ventures, the more he senses that he’s not alone. Strange creatures, their eyes glowing in the dark, lurk just beyond the edges of his vision, and he hears occasional footsteps that echo too closely for comfort.

The air is charged with magic, and the landscape is filled with ancient ruins, forgotten temples, and wild, untamed forces. But most unsettling of all is the absence of any other human presence. Where are the others? Who is in charge of this strange realm? And what terrible secret lies hidden in the heart of this enchanted world?

With no memory, no guide, and only his wits to rely on, Viraj must survive. The land is dangerous, full of traps and mysteries, and even the creatures that inhabit it seem to be caught between dreams and nightmares. Every decision he makes will bring him closer to either the truth of who he is or the doom that awaits those who dare venture too deep.

The choice is his, but time is running out. Every step forward brings him closer to unlocking the mysteries of the enchanted land—or losing himself completely.
